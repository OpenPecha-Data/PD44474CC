The Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King

by Patrul Rinpoche

The Commentary

Homage to the incomparable lord of compassion, my root master, in all his kindness!

In order to explain, in a few crucial points, how to take to heart the practice of view, meditation
and action, first of all, as the lama embodies completely the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha
simply to pay homage to him alone is to pay homage to all sources of refuge everywhere.
And so: “Homage to the master!”

Now for the main subject: If you take the practice to heart, while recognizing that the root
and lineage masters are all inseparable from the true nature of your mind, this embodies
the actual practice of view, meditation and action. So view, meditation and action are explained
here by relating them to the meaning of the root and lineage masters’ names.

First, the View is the realization that all the infinite appearances (rabjam) of saṃsāra and
nirvāṇa, in their entirety, are perfectly contained and by nature equal within the all-encompassing
space of the vast expanse (longchen) of buddha nature, which is the true nature
of reality, free from any elaboration or complexity. And so: “The view is Longchen Rabjam:
infinite, vast expanse”.

This view of the freedom from all elaboration is realized conclusively with the wisdom (khyen)
that is the insight of vipaśyanā; and to rest evenly and one-pointedly in that state of
śūnyatā, without ever separating from the skilful means of the śamatha of loving compassion
(tsé), is the meditation that unites emptiness and compassion. So, “Meditation is Khyentse
Özer: rays of wisdom and love”.

Action is to be imbued with such a view and meditation and then to practise the six perfections
so as to benefit others, in keeping with the ways of the bodhisattvas, “the new shoots
of the buddhas”. So, “Action is Gyalwé Nyugu, that of the bodhisattvas”.

To show how fortunate is the person who practises such view, meditation and action, “One who
practises in such a way,”

Those who are able to seclude themselves in an isolated retreat, put aside the worldly cares
and activities of this life and practise single-mindedly, will gain liberation—in their very
lifetime—in the ground of primordial purity. So, “May well attain enlightenment in this
very life”.

However, even if not, simply by turning your mind towards such view, meditation, and action,
you will know how to transform all life’s difficulties into the path, you will have less
hope and fear about the preoccupations of this life, and in the next life you will go from
happiness to happiness. So, “And even if not, what happiness! What joy! A la la!”

In order to explain, step by step, such a beneficial view, meditation and action, first I wish
to set out at greater length how to take to heart and practise the view. And “As for the
view, Longchen Rabjam,”

The entire meaning of this is imparted in this advice on the three statements, for when they
strike the vital point of practice, delusion is put to death. So: “Three statements strike
the vital point”.

I. Introducing Directly the Face of Rigpa Itself

First is the method of introducing the view that has not yet been revealed. Generally speaking,
there are many ways of bringing the view to realization. In the sūtrayāna path of dialectics
the method of lung rig is employed; that is, using the scriptural authority of the
teaching of Buddha and the great masters, and through logic and reasoning, arriving at the
realization of the view.

According to the common approach of Secret Mantrayāna, by means of the wisdom of example in
the third empowerment, one is introduced to the real, ultimate wisdom in the fourth empowerment.
Here, according to the special approach of the great masters of the practice lineage,
the nature of mind, the face of rigpa, is introduced in and upon the very dissolution of
conceptual mind.

Amidst the churning waves of delusory thinking, the gross arising thoughts which run after the
objects of perception obscure the actual face of mind’s true nature. So even if it were
introduced, you would not recognize it. Therefore, in order to allow these gross discursive
thoughts to settle and clear, “First, relax and release your mind”,

However, leaving your own mind relaxed and uncontrived is itself the wisdom of clear light.
So paths that are contrived can never bring you to the realization of your true nature, and
to signify that this uncontrived co-emergent wisdom is there, present within you: “Neither
scattered, nor concentrated, without thoughts”.

When you are a beginner, even if you maintain mind’s fundamental state, resting naturally, it
will not be possible for you to avoid fixation on the many experiences such as ‘bliss’,
‘clarity’ and ‘non-conceptuality’ that come in the state of calm and stillness: “While resting
in this even state, at ease”.

To free yourself from the ‘cocoon’ of attachment-to-experience, lay bare the all-penetrating
rigpa and reveal explicitly its true state, “Suddenly let out a mind-shattering phaṭ!”,

Since it is vital to cut through the flow of arising thoughts, and destroy meditation made by
the mind, the sound ‘phaṭ!’ should be fierce, forceful and abrupt: “Fierce, forceful, and
abrupt. How amazing (emaho)!”

At this moment, you are free from all fixed notions of what mind might be, and liberation itself
is actualized: “There is nothing there: transfixed in wonder,”

In that state of dharmakāya, devoid of any reference or reliance whatsoever, all-penetrating,
naked awareness dwells, just as it is, as the wisdom that transcends the mind, and so: “Struck
by wonder (hedawa), and yet all is transparently clear (zang tal lé)”.

This all-penetrating, unimpeded awareness is the key point of inexpressible and naturally inherent
wisdom, beyond all extremes such as rising and ceasing, existing and non-existing,
and so beyond words and out of reach of mental enquiry. “Fresh, pure and sudden, so beyond
description:”

The crucial point here is that rigpa, which abides as the ground of dharmakāya, is the primordial
purity of the path of the yogins, the absolute view of freedom from all elaboration.
Until you recognize this one point, then whatever meditation or practice you do, you can
never get beyond a fabricated mind-made view and meditation.The difference between this and
the approach of the natural Dzogpachenpo is greater than that between earth and sky, as
it does not possess the essential point—the unceasing flow of clear light, which is non-meditation.
So it is most important, first of all, to recognize this and this alone, and: “Recognize
this as the pure awareness of dharmakāya”.

This, then, is the first of the three statements which strike the vital point. If the view has
not been introduced and recognized, there is nothing to maintain in meditation. This is
why it is so important, first and foremost, to be introduced to the view.

And since the natural, inherent wisdom is introduced as something natural and inherent in you,
it is neither to be sought elsewhere, nor is it something that you did not have before,
and that now arises newly in your mind. So: “The first vital point is: introducing directly
the face of rigpa in itself”.

II. Deciding upon One Thing, and One Thing Only

Now to give a more detailed explanation of how to take the practice of meditation to heart:

In a natural state of rest, all the time and in any situation, let your meditation be like the
continuous flow of a river.

Without cultivating stillness or suppressing the movement of thought, simply maintain the recognition
that when stillness occurs, it is the dharmakāya’s own face, and when movement arises,
it is the inherent power of wisdom. And: “Then, whether in a state of movement or stillness,”

From the energy of mind’s thinking come negative emotions like anger and attachment that constitute
the truth of the origin of suffering, as well as feelings like happiness and sorrow,
which constitute the truth of suffering itself. Yet whatever experiences arise, if you
can realize that the true nature of these thoughts and emotions is the very nature of reality,
they will be just the flow of dharmakāya. And so: “Of anger or attachment, happiness
or sorrow,”

Furthermore, generally speaking, even though you may have recognized the view, if you do not
sustain it in meditation, and you slip into the ordinary proliferation of delusion, the same
old patterns of thought will bind you to saṃsāra. As a result, the Dharma and you become
divorced, and you end up no different from an ordinary person. That is why you must never
be apart from this supreme state of resting naturally in non-meditation, and why: “All
the time, in any situation,”

Therefore, whether the mind is still, active or whatever, it is not a question of overcoming
each individual negative emotion and thought with its own separate remedy. Instead, the sole
remedy for whatever thought or emotion may occur, the one remedy for all, is the recognition
of that view which was introduced before, and that alone: “Recognize that dharmakāya
you recognized before,”

So, whatever thought or emotion arises, in itself it is no other than the wisdom of dharmakāya,
and the true nature of these thoughts and emotions is the actual clear light of the ground
of dharmakāya. When you recognize this, that is what is known as ‘the mother clear light
present as the ground’.

To recognize your own nature in that view of the clear light of self-knowing rigpa introduced
earlier by the master is what is known as ‘the path clear light of practice.’ To remain
in the state where these two, the clear light of ground and path, are inseparable is known
as ‘the meeting of mother and child clear light’. “And mother and child clear light, already
acquainted, will reunite”.

In this way, always remind yourself of the view, which is the clear light recognized in you
as your true nature. And as you are resting in that state, you should neither suppress nor
indulge, neither accept nor reject, in any way, the thoughts and emotions that are its dynamic
energy (tsal). This is a crucial point: “Rest in the aspect of awareness, beyond all
description”.

When you maintain that state for a long time, as a beginner you will have experiences of bliss,
clarity or non-conceptuality, which will mask the face of your true nature. So if you
free it from this shell of attachment-to-experience, and lay bare the actual face of rigpa,
then wisdom will shine out from within.

There is a saying:

The more its flow is interrupted,The better the water in the mountain stream.The more it is
disrupted,The better the meditation of the yogin.

So: “Stillness, bliss and clarity: disrupt them, again and again,”

“How to disrupt them?” you might ask. Whenever experiences of stillness, bliss or clarity arise,
or feelings of joy, glee or delight, you must pulverize the shell of your attachment-to-experience,
shattering it as if by a bolt of lightning, with the forceful sound of ‘phaṭ!’
which is the combination of ‘pha’, the syllable of skilful means that concentrates and
gathers and ‘ṭa’, the syllable of prajna which cuts through. “Suddenly striking with the
syllable of skilful means and wisdom”.

When you do not lose this vital point of personal experience, and you maintain that indescribable,
all-penetrating rigpa, all the time and in every situation, formal meditation and post-meditation
will no longer be distinct: “With no difference between meditation and post-meditation,”

That is why the meditation in sessions and the meditation when you are active during breaks
are not separate: “No division between sessions and breaks,”

In this ‘great meditation with nothing to meditate on’, the continuous river-like yoga of inherent,
even and all-pervasive wisdom, there is not even a hair’s breadth of anything to meditate
on, nor an instant of distraction.

This is what is meant by the saying:

Neither do I ever meditate, nor am I ever separate from it;

So I have never been separate from the true meaning of ‘non-meditation’.And that is why: “Always
remain in this indivisible state”.

If someone is a suitable and receptive vessel for the unique path of Dzogpachenpo, just as the
teachings themselves intend, and he or she belongs to the ‘instantaneous’ type of person
who is liberated upon hearing the teaching, then, for such a person, perception and thoughts
are the supreme ground for liberation, and anything that happens becomes the flow of
dharmakāya. 

There is nothing to meditate on, and no one to meditate.Others, however, who are less fortunate
and who still fall prey to delusory thinking must find stability in ‘gradual stages’.
Until they do so, they must engage in the practice of meditation. Therefore: “But until stability
is attained,”

That meditation must be practised when all the conditions favourable for meditative stability
are complete; only then will real experience occur. No matter how long you spend meditating
in the midst of busyness and distraction, true meditation experience will not arise, and
so: “It is vital to meditate, away from all distractions and busyness”.

While meditating too, though there is no difference between practice in formal sessions and
post-meditation, if you are not truly grounded in your meditation first, you will be unable
to blend the wisdom you experience with your post-meditation. However hard you try to turn
your daily life into the path, your vague and generalized understanding makes you prone
to slip back into your old negative patterns and habits. Therefore: “Practising in proper
meditation sessions”.

You might have the sort of practice which makes you confident that you can keep up this state
of meditation in proper sessions. Even so, if you do not understand how to integrate that
practice with the activities of post-meditation and how to maintain it continuously, then
this practice will not serve as a remedy when difficulties arise. When some discursive thought
leads you off, you will sink back into very ordinary things. This is why it is so crucially
important to abide in that all-penetrating state of awareness after meditation: “All
the time, in any situation,”

At that point, there is no need to seek for anything else on which to meditate. Instead, in
a state of meditative equipoise that never parts from this very view of dharmakāya,maintain
a carefree nonchalance towards all actions and all thoughts, without suppressing or indulging
them, but letting things come and go, one after another, and leaving them be: “Abide
by the flow of what is only dharmakāya”.

A practice such as this, which is the indivisible union of śamatha and vipaśyanā, the yoga of
the natural state free from elaboration, the uncontrived and innate, the abiding by the
face of the intrinsic nature of reality, is the heart of the practice of all the tantras of
the Secret Mantra Vajrayāna. It is the ultimate wisdom of the fourth empowerment. It is
the speciality, the wish-fulfilling gem, of the practice lineage. It is the flawless wisdom
mind of all the accomplished masters and their lineages, of India and Tibet, of both old
(nyingma) and new (sarma) traditions.

So decide on this, with absolute conviction, and do not hanker after other pith instructions,
your mouth watering with an insatiable appetite and greed. Otherwise it is like keeping
your elephant at home and looking for its footprints in the forest.

You walk into the trap of unending mental research, and then liberation will never have a chance.
Therefore you must decide on your practice, and: “Decide with absolute conviction that
there is nothing other than this—”

Make a decision then that this naked wisdom of dharmakāya, naturally present, is the awakened
state, which has never known delusion, and abide by its flow: this is the second secret
and vital word. Since it is so crucially important: “The second vital point is: deciding upon
one thing, and one thing only”.

III. Confidence Directly in the Liberation of Rising Thoughts

Now, at such times as these, if there is not the confidence of the method of liberation, and
your meditation is merely relaxing in the stillness of mind, you will only get side-tracked
into the samadhi of the gods. Such a meditation will not be able to overcome your attachment
or anger. It will not be able to put a stop to the flow of karmic formations. Nor will
it be able to bring you the deep confidence of direct certainty. Therefore, this method
of liberation is of vital importance.

What is more, when a burning attachment is aroused towards some object of desire, or violent
anger towards an object of aversion, when you feel joy about favourable circumstances, material
possessions and the like, or you are afflicted by sorrow on account of unfavourable
circumstances and things like illness—no matter what happens—at that moment the power of
your rigpa is aroused, and so it is vital to recognize the wisdom that is the ground for liberation.
“At that point, whether attachment or aversion, happiness or sorrow—”

Besides, if your practice lacks the key point of “liberation upon arising”, whatever subtle
thoughts creep unnoticed into your mind will all accumulate more saṃsāric karma.

So, the crucial point is to maintain this simultaneous arising and liberation with every thought
that rises, whether gross or subtle, so that they leave no trace behind them. “All momentary
thoughts, each and every one,”

Therefore, whatever thoughts arise, you do not allow them to proliferate into a welter of subtle
delusion, while at the same time you do not apply some narrow mind-made mindfulness.
Instead:

Without ever separating from a natural genuine mindfulness, recognize the true nature of whatever
thoughts arise, and sustain this ”liberation upon arising” that leaves no trace, like
writing on the surface of water. So: “Upon recognition, leave not a trace behind”.

If, at this point, the arising thoughts are not purified, dissolving as they liberate themselves,
the mere recognition of thoughts on its own will not be able to cut the chain of the
karma that perpetuates delusion. So at the very same instant as you recognize, by seeing
the true nature of the thought nakedly, you will simultaneously identify the wisdom with which
you are familiar from before. By resting in that state, thoughts are purified, dissolving
so that they leave no trace, and that dissolution is a crucial point. “For recognize
the dharmakāya in which they are freed,”

To take an example: writing or drawing on water. The very instant it is written, it dissolves—the
writing and its disappearance are simultaneous. Likewise, as soon as thoughts arise,
liberation is simultaneous, and so it becomes an unbroken flow of “self-arising and self-liberating”:
“And just as writing vanishes on water,”

And so, by not suppressing the risings, but allowing whatever arises to arise, any thoughts
that do arise are actually purified into their own fundamental nature. You must hold to this
method of integrating everything into the path as the essence of the practice: “Arising
and liberation become natural and continuous”.

By applying the ‘exercise of dharmakāya’ to your thoughts in this way, whatever thoughts occur
only serve to strengthen the rigpa. And however gross the thoughts of the five poisons
are, that much more vivid and sharp is the rigpa in which they are liberated. “And whatever
arises is food for the bare rigpa emptiness,”

Whatever thoughts may stir, they all arise from the all-penetrating true face of rigpa itself
as its own inner power. Whenever they occur, if you simply abide in this, without accepting
or rejecting, then they are liberated at the very instant they arise, and they are never
outside the flow of the dharmakāya: “Whatever stirs in the mind is the inner power of the
dharmakāya king”.

Thoughts in the mind, the delusory perceptions of ignorance, are pure within the expanse of
dharmakāya that is the wisdom of rigpa, and so within that expanse of uninterrupted clear
light whatever thoughts stir and arise are by their very nature empty. So: “Leaving no trace,
and innately pure. What joy!”

When you have become used to integrating thoughts into your path like this over a long period
of time, thoughts arise as meditation, the boundary between stillness and movement falls
away, and as a result, nothing that arises ever harms or disturbs your dwelling in awareness:
“The way things arise may be the same as before,”

At that juncture, the way that thoughts, the energy [of rigpa], arise as joy and sorrow, hope
and fear, may be similar to the way they arise in an ordinary person. Yet with ordinary
people, their experience is a very solid one of suppressing or indulging, with the result
that they accumulate karmic formations and fall prey to attachment and aggression.  

On the other hand, for a Dzogchen yogin, thoughts are liberated the moment they arise:

at the beginning, arising thoughts are liberated upon being recognized, like meeting an old
friend;in the middle, thoughts are liberated by themselves, like a snake uncoiling its own
knots;at the end, arising thoughts are liberated without causing either benefit or harm,
like a thief breaking into an empty house.

So, the Dzogchen yogin possesses the vital point of the methods of liberation such as these.
Therefore, “But the difference lies in the way they are liberated: that’s the key.”

That is why it is said:

To know how to meditate,But not how to liberate—How does that differ from the meditation of
the gods?

What this means is that those who put their trust in a meditation which lacks this vital point
of the method of liberation, and is merely some state of mental quiescence, will only stray
into the meditation states of the higher realms. People who claim that it is sufficient
simply to recognize stillness and movement are no different from ordinary people with their
deluded thinking.

And as for those who give it all kinds of labels like ‘emptiness’ and ‘dharmakāya’, the basic
flaw in their remedy is exposed when it fails to hold up under the first misfortune or difficulty
they meet. So: “Without this, meditation is but the path of delusion”.

‘Liberation on arising’, ‘self-liberation’, ‘naked liberation’, whatever name you give it this
manner of liberation where thoughts liberate themselves and are purified without a trace
is the same crucial point: explicitly to show this self-liberation. It is the extraordinary
speciality of the natural Dzogpachenpo,  

And so if you possess this key point, then whatever negative emotions or thoughts arise simply
turn into dharmakāya. All delusory thoughts are purified as wisdom. All harmful circumstances
arise as friends. All negative emotions become the path.saṃsāra is purified in its
own natural state, without your having to renounce it, and you are freed from the chains of
both conditioned existence, and the state of peace. You have arrived at such a complete
and final state, there is no effort, nothing to achieve, and nothing left to do. And: “When
you have it, there’s non-meditation, the state of dharmakāya”.

If you do not have the confidence of such a way of liberation, you can claim your view is high
and your meditation is deep, but it will not really help your mind and nor will it prove
a remedy for your negative emotions. Therefore, this is not the true path.

On the other hand, if you do have the key point of ‘self-arising and self-liberating’, then
without even the minutest attitude of a ‘high view’ or notion of a ‘deep meditation’, it is
quite impossible for your mind not to be liberated from the bonds of dualistic grasping.

When you go to the fabled Island of Gold, you can never find ordinary earth or stones, however
hard you look. In just the same way, stillness, movement and thoughts, all arise now as
meditation, and even if you search for real, solid delusions, you will not find any. And
this alone is the measure to determine whether your practice has hit the mark or not, so:
“The third vital point is: confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts”.

IV. The Colophon

These three key points are the unerring essence which brings the view, meditation, action and
fruition, of natural Dzogpachenpo all together within the state of the all-penetrating awareness
of rigpa. So in fact this constitutes the pith instructions for meditation and action,
as well as for the view.

However this is not some abstract concept about which, to use the Dharma terminology of the
mainstream textual tradition, a definitive conclusion is reached after evaluating it with
scripture, logic and reasoning.

Rather, once you actually realize wisdom itself directly and in all its nakedness, that is the
view of the wisdom of rigpa. Since all the many views and meditations have but ‘a single
taste’, there is no contradiction in explaining the three vital points as the practice of
the view. So: “For the View which has the three vital points,”

A practice such as this is the infallible key point of the path of primordial purity in the
natural Dzogpachenpo, the very pinnacle of the nine graduated vehicles. Just as it is impossible
for a king to travel without his courtiers, in the same way the key points of all yanas
serve as steps and supports for the Dzogchen path. Not only this, but when you see the
face of the lamp of naturally arising wisdom—the primordial purity of rigpa—its power will
blaze up as the insight that comes from meditation. Then the expanse of your wisdom swells
like a rising summer river, while the nature of emptiness dawns as great compassion, so
infusing you with a loving compassion without any limit or bias. This is how it is, and:
“Meditation, the union of wisdom and love,”

Once this key point on the path, the unity of emptiness and compassion, is directly realized,
the ocean-like actions of the bodhisattvas, all included within the path of the six pāramitās,
arise as its own natural energy, like the rays shining from the sun.

Since action is related to the accumulation of merit, anything you do will be for the benefit
of others, helping you to avoid seeking peace and happiness for yourself alone, and so deviating
from the correct view. So it: “Is accompanied by the Action common to all the bodhisattvas”.

This kind of view, meditation and action is the very core of the enlightened vision of all the
buddhas who ever came, who are here now or who will ever come, and so: “Were all the buddhas
of past, present and future to confer,”

The supreme peak of all the yanas, the key point on the path of the Vajra Heart Essence of the
Nyingtik, the quintessence of all fruition—nothing surpasses this. And so: “No instruction
would they find greater than this”.

The real meaning of what is expressed in this instruction is the heart-essence of the pith instructions
of the lineage, it is certain; yet even the lines that express it, these few words,
should arise, too, out of the creative power of rigpa. So: “By the tertön of dharmakāya,
the inner power of rigpa,”

I have not the slightest experience of the actual meaning behind these words as a result of
‘the wisdom that comes from meditation’. Yet by hearing the unerring oral transmission of
my holy master, I cleared away all doubts completely with ‘the wisdom that comes from listening’,
and then came to a conclusive understanding through ‘the wisdom born of contemplation’,
whereupon I composed this. And so it was: “Brought out as a treasure from the depth
of transcendental insight,”

It is unlike any ordinary kind of worldly treasure, which might simply bring temporary relief
from poverty. “Nothing like ordinary treasures of earth and stone,”

These three vital points of the view, known as ‘Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements’,
were given by the nirmāṇakāya Garab Dorje, from within a cloud of light in the sky as he
passed into nirvāṇa, to the great master Mañjuśrīmitra. These are the very pith-instructions
through which their realization became inseparable. “For it is the final testament of
Garab Dorje,”

It was through penetrating to the essential meaning of this instruction that the omniscient
king of Dharma, Longchen Rabjam, during his life-time directly realized the ‘wisdom mind’
of primordial purity, where all phenomena are exhausted and so awakened to complete and perfect
buddhahood. Actually appearing in his wisdom body to the vidyādhara Jikmé Lingpa, he
blessed him in the manner of the ‘sign transmission of the vidyādharas’. From him in turn,
by means of ‘the transmission from mouth to ear’, our own kind root master, Jikmé Gyalwé
Nyugu, received the introduction through this instruction, and encountered the true nature
of reality face to face. And this is the instruction I heard from Jikmé Gyalwé Nyugu, while
he was present among us as the glorious protector of all beings. That is why it is: “The
essence of the wisdom mind of the three transmissions”.

Pith-instructions such as these are like the finest of gold, like the very core of the heart.
It would be a pity to teach them to people who would not put them into practice.  

But then again it would be a pity, too, not to teach them to a person who would cherish these
instructions like his or her own life, put their essential meaning into practice, and attain
buddhahood in a single lifetime. So:

“It is entrusted to my heart-disciples, sealed to be secret.It is profound in meaning, my heart’s
words.It is the words of my heart, the crucial key point.This crucial point, do not
let it go to waste!Never let this instruction slip away from you!”

With this brief commentary, ‘The Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King’ is complete
at this point. Virtue! Virtue! Virtue!
